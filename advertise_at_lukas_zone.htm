<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">At Lukas Zone, you can advertise at Lukas Zone to gain 
a larger viewer base and build up website success. Your advertisement will be 
placed at the home page below the video spotlight in a visible way. To post an 
advertisement request, first, send me an email at <u><b><i>
<a href="mailto:LukasZone2003@hotmail.com">LukasZone2003@hotmail.com</a></i></b></u>. 
Your message should contain a banner image as an attachment, the link to your 
website (social media accounts are accepted if you want to do that), and 
anything else you want to include (optional). Please make sure your website 
follows these rules before posting an ad request:</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">1. Your website must follow the
<a href="https://neocities.org/terms">Neocities Terms Of Service</a> (even if 
your website isn't hosted on neocities).</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">2. If your banner exceeds an area of 122500 pixels 
(multiply the dimensions), The image will be manually resized to fit the 
website.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">3. The website you specify must be your own website.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">4. Your banner and website should not contain an 
obvious workaround. EXAMPLE: your banner image is 1x122500 to break the website.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Upon approval, you should see your ad on Lukas Zone in 
a range of 1-20 days.</font></p>
